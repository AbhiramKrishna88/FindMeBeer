# Find Me Beer

This is my  first React app!! I have created it as a Hacktoberfest project to get some experience working with APIs.

The idea behind the site is to take a location from the user and return a list of nearby breweries and their relevant info. This is done using the *Open Brewery DB API* found here: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/.

## Usage

This is built using the create-react-app boilerplate. You can view all the related documentation in the REACT_APP_README.md file.

## Contributing

This is largely a personal learning project, but feel free to ask to be assigned to any open issue. If you wish to take this in your own direction, I encourage you to fork this repo.

## ToDos

- [X] Remove fluff and change to SPA
- [X] Replace whitespace with '_' for API compatibility
- [ ] Fix text spacing within cards
- [ ] Make input field and button pretty
