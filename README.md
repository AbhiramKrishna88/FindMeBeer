# Find Me Beer

This is my  first React app!! I have created it as a Hacktoberfest project to get some experience working with APIs.

The idea behind the site is to take a location from the user and return a list of nearby breweries and their relevant info. This is done using the *Open Brewery DB API* found here: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/.
